        <h1>What is Mocha Coffee</h1>
        <img src="mocha_finished.jpeg">
        <p>Mocha is a sweet, chocolatey and sometimes creamy drink.
            Mocha is often made differently across the world. 
            A basic template is a shot of espresso with 
            a chocolate powder or syrup, followed by milk or cream. 
            It is a latte varient, 
            and as a result often has 1/3 espresso and 2/3 steamed milk. 
            However, a chocolate flavour is added, and this can be milk or dark.

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <P>This recipe is a quick and easy drink using Keurig pods.
            I'm specifically using Mcdonald's "McCafe Iced Mocha Frappe" pod
            So this requires a Coffee machine that using Keurig pods.
            I don't like to handhold so the measurement are to your liking.
            Use you creamer of choice as well.
